- 🔭 I’m currently working on **embedded systems for medical devices and automotive electronics.**
- 🤝 I’m looking for help with integrating embedded firmware with cloud platforms (AWS, Docker) and exploring how AI can be deployed efficiently on edge devices.
 
-  I’m a Firmware Engineer with 5+ years of experience in embedded systems for medical devices and automotive electronics. My expertise includes ARM Cortex-M/A architectures, RTOS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr, VxWorks, Nucleus), device drivers, hardware bring-up, and post-silicon validation.

   I work hands-on with hardware using JTAG, oscilloscopes, and logic analyzers, while also building scalable workflows through automation tools like Jenkins CI/CD and cloud    platforms like AWS and Docker.

   I’m always curious about the future — especially how firmware can integrate with AI-driven solutions to create smarter, more connected embedded systems.

  🌟 What I Do

   - Develop reliable firmware in C/C++ for safety-critical and high-performance systems

   - Collaborate across hardware, software, manufacturing, and QA teams

   - Automate testing and validation pipelines with Python, Jenkins CI/CD, AWS, and Docker

   - Debug and optimize firmware at the hardware level with advanced tools

   - Document designs, validation results, and compliance processes

   🚀 What I’m Interested In

   - Firmware development and board bring-up (RTOS, drivers, BSPs)

   - IoT and intelligent edge systems that combine embedded firmware with AI capabilities

   - Process automation and DevOps for embedded systems to improve reliability and speed

   - 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [https://github.com/Bisampi07](https://github.com/Bisampi07)
